= Introduction =

This page describes the components and the python engine and the operational process.


= Details =

== operational engine ==

 * Analysis

   runs the ocean model forced with anlysis or real data (surface and boundary forcings)

 * Forecast

   runs the model froced with predictions


== operational cycle ==

 # check/wait for the required forcing and initial conditions
 # creation of model input files
 # ocean simulation
 # plot/manage model input/output

The cycle is repeated continuously. Ocean model initial conditions come from the restart file of the previous day analysis simulation


== modules ==
